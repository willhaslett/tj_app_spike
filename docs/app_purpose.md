# Project description
I am an engineer at Stripe, so I know the codebase and features well.
There is an existing Stripe App called "Taxually" that allows users to file their sales tax with our partner organization, Taxually.
What we're doing in this project is creating an proof of concept app that provides similar funciontality to the Taxually app, but it will be for connecting to TaxJar (a Stripe-owned company) rather than Taxually.
Our goal is to get a spike working that spoofs the backend of the app (if that's possible), providing hard-coded json responses following an api that we have yet to design.
We also want a nice looking UI, this is for demo purposes to leadership.

The source for the Taxually app, which will be significantly different from our app, can be found in /taxually_app
